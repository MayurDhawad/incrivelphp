                        <p class="p4-text">Making a logo means knowing what color and shapes will go together to make an image. Some business people are artistic enough to create their own logo and can manipulate computer software well so that the final logo design will look like the work of a pro. But others may need assistance from the more artistic types. It is important too that you are aware of what your industry is and the role that your business plays in it. For example, if you are running a software development company then you need to develop a logo that will show people what your business does or how it operates. The logo could be based on the shape of a computer, or the shape of a computer mouse â€“ you could then tweak it so that it can still be recognizable but become unique enough that others cannot copy it.</p>
